# About me

Hi there. My name is CauÃª and I feel a little awkward to talk about myself like this.

I'm a programmer who really loves what he does. I'm the main developer behind the [Haxe](http://haxe.org) C# and Java
targets, and even though I can program in many different languages - mainly OCaml, JavaScript, C#, Java, C (and in a lesser extent,
Objective-C and C++) and others -, I love Haxe because of its potential, its expressiveness and its meta-programming capabilities.
Haxe solves a lot of real-world problems - specially in choosing the right technology for a cross-platform environment
and making each component communicate to each other. While every vendor is trying to lock you into their platforms, Haxe liberates
you from that, and allows to target efficiently (and natively) other platforms.

Apart from this, my main interests in programming are related to efficient cross-platform abstractions, compiler design, optimizations, 
game programming and art with technology, and server-side programming. I love to create tools and libraries that make life easier.

I also like games, history, cinema and other geeky stuff.
